Autograde
==========
Autograde looks in a specified directory for:
 1) Reference implementation (sub-directory: reference)
 2) Example input files (sub-directory: input)
 3) Student submissions (sub-directory: submissions)
 4) A program that tests the reference/solution (filename: executor)

When first executed, autograde will compile (run `make`) the reference
implementation.  Once the refernce is completed, it will run over all the
example input files as follows:
 ./executor [input-file] > [output-file]
Where input-file is a file in the input/ sub-directory and will create
output-file in the output/reference/ sub-directory.
The "executor" program can be as simple as:
 #!/bin/bash
 INPUT=$1
 ./binary-name < $INPUT
Allowing multiple binaries to be tested against the same input and allows
customization to your heart's content.

Once the output directory is filled with the reference implementation's
("correct") solutions, the script begins running through each
sub-directory in the submission directory.  Once a submission is built,
it is executed the same way as the reference implementation and the
output is compared to the "correct" solution.  The resulting output and
diff are stored in output/<name>/.
